# Railway Deploy Guide

## üöÄ Deploy Telegram Bot to Railway

This guide will help you deploy your Telegram bot to Railway for 24/7 operation with PostgreSQL database.

## üìã Prerequisites

- GitHub repository with your bot code
- Railway account (free tier available)
- Telegram Bot Token
- API keys: OpenAI, ElevenLabs, Replicate

## üí∞ Cost Breakdown

- **Railway Hobby Plan**: $5/month (500 hours = 24/7 coverage)
- **PostgreSQL Database**: FREE up to 512MB
- **Total**: ~$5/month (PostgreSQL free tier sufficient for most bots)

## üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Deployment

### 1. Prepare Your Repository

Ensure these files are in your repository root:
- `railway.toml` ‚úÖ
- `nixpacks.toml` ‚úÖ
- `tg_bot/` directory with all bot files ‚úÖ
- `tg_bot/requirements.txt` with `psycopg2-binary>=2.9.9` ‚úÖ

### 2. Create Railway Project

1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Sign up/login with GitHub
3. Click "New Project"
4. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
5. Choose your repository
6. Railway will auto-detect Python and start building

### 3. Add PostgreSQL Database

1. In your Railway project dashboard
2. Click "New" ‚Üí "Database" ‚Üí "PostgreSQL"
3. Railway will automatically set `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
4. Wait for database to be ready (green status)

### 4. Generate Public Domain

1. Go to your service ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Networking
2. Click "Generate Domain" 
3. Copy the domain (e.g., `my-bot.up.railway.app`)

### 5. Configure Environment Variables

In Railway project ‚Üí Variables tab, add:

```
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
ELEVEN_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key
REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=your_replicate_api_token
BASE_DIR=/app
RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN=my-bot.up.railway.app
```

**Important**: 
- `RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN` should be WITHOUT `https://`, just the domain
- `DATABASE_URL` is automatically set by Railway PostgreSQL

### 6. Deploy

1. Railway will automatically deploy when you push to main branch
2. Or manually trigger deployment in Railway dashboard
3. Check logs for successful startup

### 7. Verify Deployment

1. Check Railway logs for:
   - "Setting webhook to: https://your-domain.up.railway.app/webhook"
   - "Webhook set successfully!"
   - "Starting webhook server on port 8080"
2. Test bot in Telegram:
   - Send `/start`
   - Try generating audio
   - Try generating video
3. Check database: User data should persist between restarts
4. Verify webhook:
   ```bash
   curl https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_TOKEN>/getWebhookInfo
   ```

## üîß Configuration Details

### Database Migration
- **Local**: Uses SQLite (`genai.db`)
- **Railway**: Uses PostgreSQL (auto-configured)
- **Migration**: Automatic via SQLAlchemy

### File Management
- **Audio/Video files**: Automatically deleted after sending to user
- **Storage**: Minimal disk usage (no file accumulation)
- **Backup**: Telegram stores sent files on their servers

### Monitoring
- **Logs**: Available in Railway dashboard
- **Restarts**: Automatic on crashes
- **Health**: Bot uses webhooks on Railway (polling locally)
- **Health Check**: Available at `https://your-domain.up.railway.app/health`

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Build Fails**
- Check `requirements.txt` syntax
- Ensure `psycopg2-binary>=2.9.9` is included
- Check Railway logs for specific errors

**Database Connection Issues**
- Verify `DATABASE_URL` is set (auto-set by Railway)
- Check PostgreSQL service is running
- Ensure database is not paused

**Bot Not Responding**
- Check `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` is correct
- Verify `RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN` is set correctly (without https://)
- Check webhook status: `curl https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/getWebhookInfo`
- Verify bot is not already running elsewhere with polling
- Check Railway logs for connection errors
- Ensure public domain is generated in Railway settings

**API Errors**
- Verify all API keys are set correctly
- Check API quotas/credits
- Monitor Railway logs for API-specific errors

### Logs Location
- Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Deployments ‚Üí Logs
- Real-time logs available during deployment
- Historical logs accessible for debugging

## üìä Performance Tips

1. **File Cleanup**: Implemented automatically after sending
2. **Database**: PostgreSQL handles concurrent users better than SQLite
3. **Memory**: Bot uses ~100-200MB RAM
4. **CPU**: Minimal usage except during AI generation

## üîÑ Updates & Maintenance

### Updating Bot
1. Push changes to GitHub main branch
2. Railway auto-deploys
3. Check logs for successful deployment

### Database Backup
- Railway PostgreSQL includes automatic backups
- Consider manual exports for critical data

### Scaling
- Current setup handles 10-50 concurrent users
- For higher load, consider Railway Pro plan ($20/month)
